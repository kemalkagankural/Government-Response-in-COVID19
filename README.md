Introduction the Project
Today, Covid-19 has affected the whole world. We have been fighting this disease for over a year. With the spread of the corona virus around the world, countries have revealed many restrictions and control channels. We see that the indexes of these restrictions are linked to the increase of corona virus.

What is Project Topic?
The effect of the increase in the numbers of the corona virus on the Government Response Stringency index rate. I will compare the number of cases from the day the corona virus started to spread until the end of April and the measures taken by the states and the level of these measures.

Which visualization tools will This Project use?
I will use Google Data Studio and Google Chart, because I have change to use different graph, charts. Also they are free, and I can easily use these tools.

Why did I choose this topic?
I chose this topic because By taking precautions, the pandemic process can come to an end, and countries that consider the increase in cases can be more useful in the world health care and reduce the spread of the corona virus.

What challenges are you facing in preparing it?
I collected this dataset with the number of cases in the countries until the end of April of the world health organization. In addition, I edited the data in the study conducted by the University of Oxford and made it the way I would use it. It took my time to create charts and charts that compare this data with the country-based numbers with the Google Chart application and the measure level until the end of April.

How much data is it? And How many files?
I have two different datasets. First one is WHO Covid19 disease numbers and Other dataset is Government Response Stringency index rate. First one has 116131 files. Other has almost one million  files.
